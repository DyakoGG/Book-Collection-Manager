ðŸ’  Exercise Resume: Book Collection Manager ðŸ’ 

âœ´ In this exercise, we implemented a Book Collection Manager in Python using three parallel lists to store book information: one list for titles, one for authors, and one for status ("read" or "unread"). The position of each element in the lists corresponds to the same book, so index i in all three lists represents one complete book.

âœ´ To manage the collection, we wrote the following functions:


âœ… add_book() â†’ Adds a new bookâ€™s title, author, and status.

âœ… mark_as_read() â†’ Updates the status of a book to "read".

âœ… mark_as_unread() â†’ Updates the status of a book to "unread".

âœ… search_book() â†’ Finds and displays a bookâ€™s details if found.

âœ… list_books() â†’ Lists all books with their authors and current status.

âœ… suggest_book() â†’ Suggests a random unread book from the collection.

âœ… delete_book() â†’ Removes a book by deleting its data at the corresponding index from all three lists.


âœ´ This project helped us practice working with parallel lists and maintaining synchronization between them. It also showed how functions can make the program modular, reusable, and easier to extend.
